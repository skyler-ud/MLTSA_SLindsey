- I decided to take this class because it seems interesting and applicable in a wide variety of fields. It seems directly applicable to time-resolved spectroscopy methods, which I may run into in my research

- I'm not quite sure what I hope to learn the most, as I'm not sure what this topic is capable of fully. At the very least, I'd love to improve upon my data analysis abilities

- I think a strength that will help me in this class is my love for problem solving
